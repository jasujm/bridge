/** \brief ZAP implementation
 *
 * This class implements the ZAP protocol (https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27/ZAP/)
 * for authenticating incoming connections. Itâ€™s checked that the incoming
 * connections use CURVE mechanism. If they are, the connection is accepted. The
 * handler generates unique User-Id for the connection and publishes it along
 * with the CURVE public key for the application use.
 *
 * A worker thread is created for the ZAP handler. The thread is joined when the
 * Authenticator instance is destructed.
 *
 * Because a process may only contain one ZAP handler, only one instance of this
 * class should exist at time.

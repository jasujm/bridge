 * MessageQueue is an object receiving messages from sockets, dispatching the
 * message to correct message handler and replying. The MessageQueue object
 * does not own the sockets used to receive and send the messages. Rather
 * MessageQueue is designed to be used with MessageLoop that handles the
 * actual polling of the sockets.
 *
 * MessageQueue uses requestâ€“reply pattern. The messages sent to the message
 * queue are strings that represent commands. A recognized command
 * (i.e. command for which a handler is registered) causes the handler for
 * that command to be executed. Based on the result of the handling either
 * success or failure is reported.

 * \brief Definition of Bridge::Main::BridgeMain class
 *
 * \page bridgeapp Bridge application structure
 *
 * Bridge application uses clientâ€“server model where the backend application
 * acts as server for the frontend user interface. The interaction between the
 * backend and frontend happens using the protocol described in \ref
 * bridgeprotocol.
 *
 * \section bridgeprotocol Bridge protocol
 *
 * Bridge protocol uses ZMTP over TCP (http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23). The
 * backend opens two ZeroMQ sockets: control socket (REP) and data socket
 * (PUB).
 *
 * The control socket supports the following commands:
 *   - state
 *   - call
 *   - play
 *   - score
 *
 * The data socket publishes the following data:
 *   - state
 *   - score
 *
 * \todo This section is incomplete

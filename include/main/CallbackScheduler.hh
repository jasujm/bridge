 * the callerâ€™s stack frame. It integrates to Messaging::MessageLoop by
 * registering a socket that is internally use to notify a CallbackScheduler
 * object of callbacks to be executed.
 *
 * CallbackScheduler creates a thread on creation and joins it on
 * destruction. This thread is required to support delayed callbacks.

     * function.
     *
     * The method supports delayed scheduling. If \p timeout is nonzero,
     * CallbackScheduler will wait for the specified timeout before callback
     * will be scheduled. The method invocation will not block and the waiting
     * happens in another thread.

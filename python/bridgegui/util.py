    This object recursively freezes its (possibly) mutable argument consisting
    of nested lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries. Any object not belonging to
    the aforementioned types (including any container) must be hashable. The
    result is a hashable object that can be used e.g. as dictionary key.

    Not all distinct objects are distinct after being frozen. List freezes into
    tuple, set freezes into frozenset and dict freezes into frozenset containing
    tuples of keyâ€“value pairs.
